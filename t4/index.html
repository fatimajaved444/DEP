            <div class="project-card">
                <h3>Candu Crush</h3>
                <p>"I created a Candy Crush-like game using C++ to replicate the engaging mechanics of match-3 puzzle games.
                     This project involved designing a grid-based game board, implementing match detection algorithms, and handling 
                     user input to create a dynamic and interactive gameplay experience. By focusing on game logic, graphics, and animations,
                      I developed a comprehensive understanding of game development principles and object-oriented programming. This project allowed me to refine my skills
                     in C++ and explore the complexities of game design, resulting in a fun and challenging game that demonstrates
                      my ability to tackle intricate programming tasks."</p>
            </div>
            <div class="project-card">
                <h3>Cricket Simulator</h3>
                <p>I developed a Cricket Simulator using C++ to simulate the exciting and strategic aspects of the
                     game. This project involved implementing core cricket mechanics, such as batting, bowling, and 
                     scoring, while incorporating game logic to create a realistic simulation. Through this project,
                      I gained valuable experience in object-oriented programming and algorithm design, enhancing my 
                      ability to model complex systems and manage game state effectively. The simulator provides an engaging and interactive way to 
                    experience cricket, showcasing my skills in C++ and my enthusiasm for game development</p>

            <div class="project-card">
                <h3>Flex of FAST NUCES</h3>
                <p>Flex is a project I developed for FAST NUCES using C++ with a focus on 
                    object-oriented programming principles. This project showcases my ability to design and implement complex systems with C++,
                     incorporating advanced OOP concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation. Flex involves creating a versatile 
                     and scalable application, highlighting my skills in structuring code, managing resources, and solving real-world problems. Through this project,
                     I demonstrated my proficiency in C++ and my commitment to applying best practices in software development.</p>
